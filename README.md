### Visual Effects: Bloom, Night Vision, and Blur

This proyect provides a brief description and practical examples of how to use the **Bloom**, **Night Vision**, and **Blur** visual effects in creative projects such as video games, photography, and graphic design.

## 1. Bloom
The *Bloom* effect simulates the glow created when light interacts with lenses, spreading a soft radiance around bright areas.

---

## 2. Night Vision
The *Night Vision* effect mimics the green-tinted vision seen through night-vision devices, often accompanied by visual noise and increased contrast to highlight details in low-light conditions.


---

## 3. Blur
The Blur effect diffuses details in an image, drawing attention to specific areas or creating unique atmospheres.

### Conclusion
These effects provide powerful tools for transforming the narrative and aesthetics of your creative projects. Experiment with them to enhance your designs.
